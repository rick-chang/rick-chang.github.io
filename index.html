                        <h4>Occlusion-aware Multifocal Displays</h4>
                        Multifocal displays alleviate vergence-accommodation conflict by simultaneously showing contents on transparent focal planes placed at different depths in front of our eyes. Despite its effectiveness to create the accommodation cue, the solution weakens the occlusion cue, because any small movement of our eyes can easily cause content shown on the different focal planes to overlap. The inability for the transparent focal planes to occlude light also significantly reduces the contrast of the virtual world. In the work, we enable occlusion-aware multifocal displays by enabling each display pixels to tilt light. Using a lab prototype, we demonstrate the presence of occlusion cues as well as the increase in the contrast of the display on a range of scenes.

                        <h4>Toward Multifocal Displays with Dense Focal Stacks</h4>
                        Modern virtual reality displays suffer from the vergence-accommodation conflict, which causes discomfort and fatigue after long duration of usages.  While multifocal displays can alleviate the problem, they often have low retinal resolution due to the limited number of focal planes they can generate in a second.  In the paper, we present a first-of-its-kind multifocal display that is capable of generating a dense collection of focal planes (an order of magnitude greater in number as compared to prior work).  Operating at 1600 focal planes per second, our lab prototype can produce 3D cues even for a single eye and thereby is capable of resolving the vergence-accommodation conflict endemic to todayâ€™s VR displays.

                        <h4>One Network to Solve Them All</h4>
                        A hallmark of state-of-the-art algorithms for linear inverse problems is to train different neural nets for different problems.  This becomes very inefficient if we want to incorporate these specially-trained networks into portable devices like cell phones.   Cell phone cameras need to deal with a variety of image processing problems, from image deblurring, demosaicing, to super-resolution.  To achieve this, we propose a framework that can use a <em>single</em> network to solve <em>any</em> linear inverse problem.  This can significantly reduce the cost and complexity of the image signal processor.

                        <h4>Random feature for sparse signal classification</h4>
                        Despite its ability to approximate almost any decision boundaries, traditional kernel method is difficult to use with large datasets, due to the high memory and computational requirements in both training and test phases. Recent works on random feature have demonstrated promising results of scalable kernel method. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses for random feature on a special yet commonly seen signal class --- sparse signals. It is known that image, video, and speech signals enjoy sparse representations after proper transformation. Our results provide tightened theoretical guarantees for this kind of signals. We also propose compressive random feature, which exploits signal sparsity to reduce data acquisition, memory, and computation requirements for nonlinear classification methods in both training and test phases.

                        While existing projection techniques work well for projecting low bit-depth (8-bit) images, it becomes infeasible for high bit-depth (say, 16-bit) projection --- a capability that is increasingly desirable in many applications including cinemas and gaming. In this paper, we describe a technique for high bit-depth projection using a single light modulator by adopting intensity-modulated light sources. The proposed design involves only a minor modification to traditional projector designs, namely intensity modulation of the light sources, and hence, can be adopted widely by both traditional low bit-depth projectors and modern high dynamic-range projectors. Finally, we present a prototype to showcase and validate the performance of the proposed design.

                        The human mind is a fascinating learning machine, which can solve a variety of problems with slightest prior knowledge. 
                        While neural network methods have demonstrated huge improvement on problem solving, the mystery of human mind is still waiting to be unraveled. Here, I study the human mind from a different angle by utilizing three complementary hypotheses about the human mind from cognitive science.  Specifically, I design and analyze a learning system that mimics human mind with context-free language.<br>

                        <h4>A Test Function with Full Controllability Over Overlapping</h4>
                        While genetic algorithms work well on simple non-convex problems, it has been shown that they may fail on problems which contains complex inter-dependencies between variables.<br>
                        Our work provides an useful tool for analyzing the performance of genetic algorithms on this kind of complex problem. Specifically, we design a standardized test function to generate complex problems with controlled variable dependencies.

                    <h4>Dependency-Constrained Earth Movers' Distance</h4>
                    <p>The earth movers' distance measures the distance between two sets of points or histograms by solving the transportation problem.  Suppose there are cargoes to transport from source nodes to target nodes.
                    Given the weights of these cargoes and the distances between all source-target pairs.  The earth movers' distance calculates the minimum cost to transport these cargoes.  However, the earth movers' distance ignores the dependencies among these cargoes or points, and related source points may be transported to unrelated target points. We tackle the transportation problem with cargo dependencies and provide more accurate distance measurement when data dependencies exist. We use the proposed more accurate distance metric to improve computer vision applications, including image retrieval, color transfer. </p>
                    <h4>Message Passing Model Building Genetic Algorithm</h4> 
                    <p>The simple genetic algorithm can be easily paralleled, because all of its operators are local and not dependent on the whole population of candidate solutions.  However, when it comes to model building genetic algorithms, identifying variable dependencies from candidate solutions is not a local operator and needs to use information from the whole population.  This makes paralleled model building genetic algorithms difficult. In this work, we implement a distributed model building genetic algorithm, in which the model building process is paralleled by exchanging the distribution of each node's population.</p>

                    <h4>Association Rule Mining Genetic Algorithm</h4>
                    <p>We mine association rules from the population of candidate solutions.  These association rules are used to preserve high-fitness subsolutions.</p>
